### Kubernetes (>= 1.6)
 - kubeadm
 - Tectonic (coreos)
 - kops

### PX deploy
 - DaemonSet on all nodes including master
 - DaemonSet with zero storage on master, daemonset with storage on other nodes
 - We use host network, no POD networks
 - Provision requests received on master node on localhost:9001

### Debug PX deploy
 - List PX pods: `kubectl get pods -l name=portworx -n kube-system`
 - Describe PX pods: `kubectl describe pods -l name=portworx -n kube-system`
 - Logs of all PX pods: `kubectl logs -l name=portworx -n kube-system --tail=800`
 - Follow logs of a particular px pod: `kubectl logs -w <pod-name> -n kube-system`
 - Check for custom taints
 - Check for pod restarts
 - Standard px issues:
   -- etcd
   -- firewalls
   -- selinux
   -- docker mountflags

### Volume lifecycle
 * Create, Delete generated by Kubernetes controller manager on master node.
 * Requests sent to localhost:9001
 * Setup and TearDown sent to kubelet on each minion. So those logs are on kubelet on those nodes.
 * Setup
 ** Attach
 ** Mount
 * TearDown
 ** Unmount
  ** Detach
 - Dynamically provsioned volumes
  -- PVC's created based on StorageClass
  -- See example

### Apps
 - Deployements
    -- replicas based Pods
    -- During node failures/decommissions, pod moves from one minion to another. TearDown and Setup invoked on the PVC.
 - StatefulSets
